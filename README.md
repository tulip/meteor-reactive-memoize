Who's Behind It
====================

meteor-reactive-memoize is maintained by Tulip. Tulip is transforming manufacturing processes by bringing the latest technological advances from the lab to the shop floor. Whereas most factories are still using state of the art technology from the mid 19th century, we come from the future to bring them a rich, realtime web app, modern tablets, IoT systems, in-depth analytics, and more.

We do web development (with Meteor+React+Redux), IoT/embedded software, computer vision, data engineering, technical operations / DevOps, web-based UI design, and anything else we need to make the best product possible. Sound interesting? Email us at jobs@tulip.co.
